Developer currently involved with the [Discord Dungeons](https://discorddungeons.me) project.</br>
Sometimes I do silly things out of boredom.</br>
I believe in the "knowing where the information for things is" principle, because I can't learn everything. As long as I know the fundamentals of what something does, I can probably pick it up and learn it.
